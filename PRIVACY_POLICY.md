Anima: Privacy policy
Welcome to the Anima app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Claudi Ruiz Camps. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data created by you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
